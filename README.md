# Java-task5
# Bank Account Simulation

A simple Java-based simulation of basic bank operations using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project includes features such as balance management, deposits, withdrawals, and transaction history tracking for multiple user accounts.

---

## ✅ Objective

Simulate real-world bank account behavior using Java classes and demonstrate encapsulation, data handling, and transaction logging.

---

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Java
- VS Code
- Terminal (or Command Prompt)

---

## 🚀 Features

- Create and manage multiple bank accounts
- Deposit and withdraw money
- Track balance for each account
- Maintain a complete transaction history per account

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- `BankAccount`: Class that handles deposit, withdrawal, balance, and transaction log.
- `Main`: Contains logic to simulate multiple accounts and display their details.

---

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used

- **Encapsulation**: All account data and operations are wrapped inside the `BankAccount` class.
- **Abstraction**: User interacts only through defined methods like `deposit()` and `withdraw()`.
- **Reusability**: Multiple accounts are created using the same class.
